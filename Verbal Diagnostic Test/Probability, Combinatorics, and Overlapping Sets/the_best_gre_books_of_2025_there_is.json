  "question": "The Best GRE Books of 2025\nThere is no one-size-fits-all book to prepare for the GRE test. After all, if we would have just one book, a sort of panacea for every aspect of the test, it would be easy to have just ONE book, but this would not reflect what in the end the GRE is: a challenging test.\nThe GRE is like a puzzle. You need several elements or notions, gather them together, and put them in your toolbox to use when is necessary. In other words, to tackle this test, flexibility is paramount. Therefore, more than one source (a good source I  would say) is pivotal to use from the very beginning.\nUsually, these following books are a great starting point - they get you familiarized with the test format, sections, timing, and main strategies. Picking a book might be real quick, just search on amazon and that's it. However, this choice has great impact on your preparation since the very first moment, here is why:\nthe time and effort you infuse into your preparation can conclusively impact your final score and your chances to get into the BS you want to attend;\nthe right book not only is helpful to shorten the time dedicated to the study but also will make the process less painful and more fun in the end;\nthe practice questions contained in them - considering that they are NOT official books for the vast majority - must be as close as possible to the real GRE. Otherwise, practicing not good material will hurt you more than to have benefits you. You would have the false feeling to be prepared and in the end during the real exam will be a disaster.\nMy recommendation -\nGet at least 2 books:\nThe Official Guide to the GRE Test, Fourth Edition 4th Edition\n(OG for short),.\nAnother Book or Bundle\n- this choice will depend on your needs and the time you have.\nFor dedicated/specialized Math or Verbal GRE guidebook, see:\nBest GRE Quant Prep Books (Reviews & Recommendations)\nBest GRE Verbal Prep Books (Reviews & Recommendations)\n1. The Official Guide to the GRE Test, Fourth Edition 4th Edition\nOur REVIEW of the new OG\nPublished by the creators of the GRE. Must have to access to roughly 350 real GRE questions but lacks any strategies.\nStrengths:\nThe structure is the same as the former OG but with two more chapters. And those two chapters are what we waited for years, a nail bomb: 75 Verbal and 75 Quant questions BRAND NEW. And they are amazing. I also have the Mentor Course with the best official questions ETS could provide to you and the result is quite similar: questions for practice that represent 100% the actual real exam. . In the past, the questions in the OG were probably slightly inferior or somehow more straightforward than the questions in the real exam. Here NO. and why so ? Because they have the same imprint of the mentor course and , turns out, the mentor course is quite close tot the real exam. It is a transitive relation.\nWe have general information about the GRE. Not so many but the essential is present. It is quite important in my view that every student has a general look to the exam is going to take. Caring every single aspect of the GRE is pivotal. Even those elements or sides that look superficial.\nThe AWA section contains all the necessary elements: an example of AWA and strategy for every half-point increment. It is well done. I like it.\nWe have a general overview of both the verbal and quant sections with a syllabus of the questions-type in it\nThe overview of the sections is reinforced by practice questions both verbal and quant. 73 questions each. They are repeated or carried from the previous OG, though. They are not new.\nWe have two practice tests designed to reflect the new unfolding of the GRE since 2023. The questions are the same of the OG 3rd edition but in smaller numbers. Before, each test had 100 questions, but now 70. Not a big deal, though.\nAs mentioned earlier, we have TWO new Verbal and Quantitative Reasoning Mixed Practice Sets sections:\n150 new questions\n. The questions themselves are more challenging and tricky than ever. Especially on the verbal side, we did notice how the questions are slightly more complicated than in the past. For example, three blanks are long as text completion and have multiple shifts. Multiple sentences. It's longer than a critical reasoning question.\nWeaknesses:\nThe Math REVIEW, as in the Og 3rd edition, barely scratches the surface of the concepts tested during the exam. it is true that in this section, there is an overview of all the notions, but if you want something to dig deeper and look at the nuances and intricacies of the math portion of the test, well, you need to look and study somewhere else.\nWe would like to see a dedicated chapter conceived explicitly for the test day, for example. What to do or not to do at the test center. What does a student bring with him/her or less? What kind of assistance is provided to disabled or diversely abled people? This is a category we care about, and we try to help at our best.\nWe would like to mention the home testing. Even though all this information is provided on the ETS website, having it in the book was valuable.\nThe net worth per question is not so great. For around 50 dollars (shipping costs included but it depends where you are located geographically) you have in the end 150 fresh questions. However, for an investment of 100 dollars in the mentor course, you have a staggering number of 640 questions, and not only that, according to the official ETs website\n640+ authentic practice questions, answers and explanations\nLessons, quizzes, challenges and achievements\nContent to help you brush up and build skills\nA full-length, timed practice test (POWERPREP PLUS® 2) valued at $40\n2. All the GRE: Effective Strategies & Practice from 99th Percentile Instructors 6th Edition\nStrengths:\n1.\nStrategies & Questions that cover EVERY single aspect you need for the GRE\n2. Respect the previous version we suggested for the 2023. This version is almost completely overhauled: better organization of the contents, more focus for the new GRE instead of having a guide that somehow was derived from the GMAT and adapted to the GRE.\n3. Advanced topic such as RTD problems. Advanced concepts such as benchmarking around quantity B for QCQ questions. Optimization problems and a better focus on combinatorics and probability\n4. The strategies will help you go from the very ground up to the most advanced and obscure notions.\n5. The practice questions follow actual GRE test patterns  - probably the only book on the market\n6. Every single lesson is simple and easy to follow yet very robust. Nothing is left to chance\n5. The book's organization is basically flawless\n6. SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 500 Essential Words. 500 Advanced Words.\n7. The book has six complete tests to it. A bang for the bucks\nWeaknesses:\n1. The major negative side is that the previous highly acclaimed Set of 8 GRE Strategy Guides had at the end of every book 60 questions divided into 3 batches: easy, medium, and hard.\nThey were a blessing for those that at the end of the book would practice at the best the notions learned throughout the book.\nPerhaps, those questions now are part of the questions bank that comes along with these two books, on a \"diet\".\n3. GRE Prep Plus 2024-2025 - Updated for the New GRE\naccording to amazon\n1. Five full-length online tests help you practice in the same computer-based format you'll see on test day.\n2. One full-length practice test included in the book for when online is not an option.\n3. Online resources including two mini tests, one math and one verbal, online to help you get off to a fast start\n4. More than 1,500 questions with detailed explanations.\n5. Video explanations of selected questions.\n6. 500-question online Qbank that lets you select problems by topic and difficulty and customize your practice.\n7. Chapters on each GRE question type and math skill, with practice sets for each.\n8. Questions have been reviewed, revised, and updated by\nKaplan\n's expert faculty.\n4. GRE Prep by Magoosh\nStrengths:\n1.\n150+ really close GRE questions\n2. The practice questions follow actual GRE test patterns. However, we found that several of them are a little bit off from the real ones\n3. The explanations are well crafted. This is a crucial aspect when you are preparing for the GRE. You learn more from a good explanation than from 10 questions while practicing.\n4. One of the key aspects we always take into account when we review a book is if it has the level of difficulty of the questions: easy, medium, and hard. Pivotal reference for the student\n5. The book is well organized and comes with: a study plan, a good AWA section, a vocabulary list, and also tips about your preparation\n6 Overall, a good quality product.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Just one full GRE test is provided with the book\n2. Not as many questions as provided by other GRE books.\n3. Very good questions, both on the quant and verbal side. However, not the best questions when it comes to practicing the hard level GRE questions They do not catch the same nuance we find in the official practice questions.\n4.\nNOT update yet for the new shorter GRE\n5.

  "question": "Traditionally, public school instructors have been compensated according to seniority. Recently, the existing salary system has been increasingly criticized as an approach to compensation that rewards lackadaisical teaching and punishes motivated, highly qualified instruction. Instead, educational experts argue that, to retain exceptional teachers and maintain quality instruction, teachers should receive salaries or bonuses based on performance rather than seniority.\nWhich of the following, if true, most weakens the conclusion of the educational experts?\n(A) Some teachers express that financial compensation is not the only factor contributing to job satisfaction and teaching performance.\n(B) School districts will develop their own unique compensation structures that may differ greatly from those of other school districts.\n(C) Upon leaving the teaching profession, many young, effective teachers cite a lack of opportunity for more rapid financial advancement as a primary factor in the decision to change careers.\n(D) A merit-based system that bases compensation on teacher performance reduces collaboration, which is an integral component of quality instruction.\n(E) In school districts that have implemented pay for performance compensation structures, standardized test scores have dramatically increased.\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1",

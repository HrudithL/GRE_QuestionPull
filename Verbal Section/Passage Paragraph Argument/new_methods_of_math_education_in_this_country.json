  "question": "New methods of math education in this country do a disservice to our children. In the lower grades, math instruction should focus on the basic skills that students will need to solve complex problems in higher grades. Learning basic math skills is like learning the scales and chords that one will later use to master complicated concertos and symphonies. Increasingly, math educators in this country seem to have it backward, emphasizing in higher grades the same narrow, skills-based approach that students learned in lower grades rather than the analytical tools that they will need to solve complex math problems.\nWhich of the following, if true, would most seriously weaken the conclusion drawn above?\n(A) While music courses are often included in elementary school curricula, such classes are rarely taught in high school.\n(B) On international tests of complex math skills, high school students in this country performed no worse than did their counterparts from countries in which problem-solving is emphasized in higher grades.\n(C) When presented with a math problem to solve, students in higher grades are more likely to arrive at different answers than students in lower grades.\n(D) Older students tend to receive higher grades in math than younger students do.\n(E) Universities in this country report a steady increase in the percentage of first-year students who qualify to take courses such as engineering that requires advanced math.\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

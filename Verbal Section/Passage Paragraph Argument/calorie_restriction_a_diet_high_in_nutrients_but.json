  "question": "Calorie restriction, a diet high in nutrients but low in calories, is known to prolong the life of rats and mice by preventing heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and other diseases. A 6-month study of 48 moderately overweight people, who each reduced their calorie intake by at least 25%, demonstrated decreases in insulin levels and body temperature, with the greatest decrease observed in individuals with the greatest percentage change in their calorie intake. Low insulin level and body temperature are both considered signs of longevity, partly because an earlier study by other researchers found both traits in long-lived people.\nIf the above statements are true, they support which of the following inferences?\n(A) Calorie restriction produces similar results in humans as it does in rats and mice.\n(B) Humans who reduce their calorie intake by at least 25% on a long-term basis will live longer than they would have had they not done so.\n(C) Calorie intake is directly correlated to insulin level in moderately overweight individuals.\n(D) Individuals with low insulin levels are healthier than individuals with high insulin levels.\n(E) Some individuals in the study reduced their calorie intake by more than 25%.\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

  "question": "A certain pharmaceutical firm recently developed a new medicine, Dendadrine, that provides highly effective treatment of severe stomach disorders that were previously thought untreatable. However, the company spent nearly $\\(\\$ \\)5$ billion to research and develop the new medicine. Given the size of the market for Dendadrine and the amount of the initial investment, the company would need to sell Dendadrine at a price that is at least five times greater than its variable costs just to break even. Yet company management claims that Dendadrine will soon become the major driver of the firm's profits.\nWhich of the following statements best reconciles the management's claim with the evidence about the expenditures associated with the development of Dendadrine?\n(A) The pharmaceutical firm expects to be granted patent protection for Dendadrine; drugs under patent protection typically sell at prices that are approximately 10 times their variable costs.\n(B) The development of some pharmaceutical products involves substantial initial expenditures on research, testing, and approval.\n(C) In clinical tests, Dendadrine has proven far more effective at treating severe stomach disorders than any prior available treatments, without any serious side effects.\n(D) No competitors are developing or planning to develop new medicines that might compete with Dendadrine in the marketplace.\n(E) Millions of people suffer from severe stomach disorders, representing an estimated one to two billion dollars every year in revenue.\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

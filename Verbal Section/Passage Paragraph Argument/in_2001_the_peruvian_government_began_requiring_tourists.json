  "question": "In 2001, the Peruvian government began requiring tourists to buy expensive permits to hike the remote Inca Trail, which goes to the ancient city of Machu Picchu. The total number of permits is strictly limited; in fact, only 500 people per day are now allowed to hike the Inca Trail, whereas before 2001, visitors numbered in the thousands. The Peruvian government argues that this permit program has successfully prevented deterioration of archaeological treasures along the Inca Trail.\nWhich of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument above?\n(A) Since 2001, tourist guides along the Inca Trail have received 50% to 100% increases in take-home pay.\n(B) Villages near Machu Picchu have experienced declines in income, as fewer tourists means fewer sales of craft goods and refreshments.\n(C) Many of the funds from the sale of Inca Trail permits are used to staff a museum of Incan culture in Peru’s capital city, Lima, and to hire guards for archaeological sites without permit programs.\n(D) Since 2001, Incan ruins similar to Machu Picchu but not on the Inca Trail have disintegrated at a significantly greater rate than those on the trail.\n(E) The total number of tourists visiting Peru has risen substantially since 2001, even as the number of tourists hiking the Inca Trail has remained constant.\nKudos for\nR.A.E\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

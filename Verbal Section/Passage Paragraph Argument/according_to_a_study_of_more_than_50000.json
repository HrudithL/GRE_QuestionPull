As a result, the sponsors of the study claim that reducing nicotine intake does not improve one's health.\nWhich of the following, if true, most seriously jeopardizes the findings of the study described above?\n(A) The majority of study participants minimized their nicotine withdrawal symptoms through the use of skin patches and chewing gum that provide nicotine to the body.\n(B) Many of the study's participants periodically dined in restaurants in which smoking was permitted.\n(C) The study's participants started smoking at different ages and had varied initial nicotine intake.\n(D) Quitting smoking entirely results in a marked reduction in the ill effects of smoking.\n(E) Men and women who smoked pipes and cigars were excluded from the study.\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

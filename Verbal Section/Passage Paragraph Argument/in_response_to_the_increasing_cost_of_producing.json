  "question": "In response to the increasing cost of producing energy through traditional means, such as combustion, many utility companies have begun investing in renewable energy sources, chiefly wind and solar power, hoping someday to rely on them completely and thus lower energy costs. The utility companies claim that although these sources require significant initial capital investment, they will provide stable energy supplies at low cost. As a result, these sources will be less risky for the utilities than nonrenewable sources, such as gas, oil, and coal, whose prices can fluctuate dramatically according to availability.\nThe claim of the utility companies presupposes which of the following?\n(A) The public will embrace the development of wind and solar power.\n(B) No new deposits of gas, oil, and coal will be discovered in the near future.\n(C) Weather patterns are consistent and predictable.\n(D) The necessary technology for conversion to wind and solar power is not more expensive than the technology needed to create energy through combustion.\n(E) Obtaining energy from nonrenewable sources, such as gas, oil, and coal, cannot be made less risky.\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

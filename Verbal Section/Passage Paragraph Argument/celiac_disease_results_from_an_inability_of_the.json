  "question": "Celiac disease results from an inability of the digestive tract, specifically the small intestine, to absorb gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and certain other grains.

People who suffer from celiac disease must eliminate gluten from their diets. Symptoms of the disease include abdominal cramps, bloating, and anemia.\nIf the statements above are true, which of the following assertions can be made on the basis of them?\n(A) Anyone who suffers from celiac disease will experience anemia.\n(B) Eliminating gluten from one’s diet will cure celiac disease.\n(C) People experiencing abdominal cramps, bloating, and anemia have celiac disease.\n(D) Gluten is found only in grains.\n(E) The human body cannot always recognize harmless substances.\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

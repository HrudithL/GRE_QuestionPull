  "question": "For nearly a century, physiologists erroneously believed that a\nbuildup of lactic acid in muscle tissue was responsible for the soreness that many people experience after strenuous exercise\n. The acid, they claimed, is the waste produced by metabolic activity in the muscle and reaches “threshold” levels, causing soreness, when the muscle has depleted its oxygen supply.\nResearchers have recently discovered, however, that lactic acid is actually the fuel that powers muscular activity\n. Therefore, the cause of muscle soreness remains unknown.\nIn the argument above, the portions in boldface play which of the following roles?\n(A) The first is an assertion that the author accepts as true; the second is a consideration in support of that assertion.\n(B) The first is an assertion that the author accepts as true; the second describes a situation that the author posits as contrary to that assertion.\n(C) The first is an assertion that the author argues against; the second is evidence presented as contrary to the author’s argument.\n(D) The first is evidence that the author believes is no longer valid; the second is additional evidence that the author uses to support his main point.\n(E) The first is a claim that the author believes to be invalid; the second is the author’s main point.\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

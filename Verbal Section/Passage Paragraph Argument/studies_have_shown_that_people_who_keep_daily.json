  "question": "Studies have shown that\npeople who keep daily diet records are far more successful at losing weight than people who don’t keep track of what they eat\n. Researchers believe that many weight-loss efforts fail because people eat more calories than they intend to consume. One study followed a group of patients who reported that they could not lose weight when consuming only 1,200 calories a day.\nThe study found that the group consumed, on average, 47% more calories than it claimed and exercised 51% less\n. In contrast, when dieters record what they eat, their actual consumption more closely matches their reported consumption.\nThe two boldface portions in the argument above are best described by which of the following statements?\n(A) The first is a conclusion reached by researchers; the second is evidence that this conclusion is correct.\n(B) The first is an explanation of why a certain theory is thought to be true; the second is an example of research results that support this theory.\n(C) The first is an example illustrating the truth of a certain theory; the second is a competing theory.\n(D) The first is a premise upon which the researchers base their opinion; the second illustrates that their opinion is correct.\n(E) The first introduces a theory that the researchers have disproved; the second is the basis for the researchers’ argument.\nKudos for\nR.A.E.\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

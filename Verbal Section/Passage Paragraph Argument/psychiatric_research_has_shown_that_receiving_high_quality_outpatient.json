  "question": "Psychiatric research has shown that receiving high-quality outpatient care, rather than being confined to an institution, produces the best quality of life for people who are mentally ill. Responding to this research, Congress in 1963 passed a law that released 95% of the mentally ill patients who had been confined to institutions. In 1983, however, researchers discovered that, on average, mentally ill people in the United States were faring worse than ever.\nWhich if the following, if true, best resolves the paradox in the above passage?\n(A) More people were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders in 1983 than in 1963.\n(B) In 1983, men who had been released from mental institutions fared worse than their female counterparts.\n(C) A number of psychiatric medications were discovered between 1963 and 1983, including some early antidepressants.\n(D) Congress never supplied the funding that would have been necessary to provide high- quality outpatient care to the newly released patients.\n(E) Most of the released patients who were doing badly in 1983 suffered from one of three mental illnesses.\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

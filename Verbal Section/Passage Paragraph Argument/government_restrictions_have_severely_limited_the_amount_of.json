  "question": "Government restrictions have severely limited the amount of stem cell research companies in the United States can conduct. Because of these restrictions, many scientists previously based in the United States and specializing in the field of stem cell research have signed long-term contracts to work for foreign companies. Recently, Congress has proposed lifting all restrictions on stem cell research.\nWhich of the following conclusions can most properly be inferred from the information above?\n(A) At least some foreign companies that conduct stem cell research work under fewer restrictions than some United States companies do.\n(B) Because scientists previously based in the U.S. are under long-term contracts to foreign companies, there will be a significant influx of foreign professionals into the United States.\n(C) In all parts of the world, stem cell research is dependent on the financial backing of local government.\n(D) In the near future, U.S. companies will no longer be at the forefront of stem cell research.\n(E) If restrictions on stem cell research are lifted, many of the scientists previously based in the United States will break their contracts to return to U.S. companies.\nKudos for\nR.A.E\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

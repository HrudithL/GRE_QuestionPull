  "question": "If life exists elsewhere in the solar system, scientists suspect it would most likely be on Europa, an ice covered moon orbiting Jupiter. However, NASA recently scrapped an unmanned science mission to Europa and reassigned most of the employees involved in the project to another project that concerns landing an astronaut on Mars. Polls show that Americans are far more fascinated by space travel than they are by discovering life elsewhere in the universe. Critics argue that NASA’s decision-making process places a greater emphasis on public interest than it does on the importance of scientific research.\nWhich of the following, if true, would most strengthen NASA’s contention that the critics are misinformed?\n(A) In 2013, NASA spent 30% of its total budget on developing a space shuttle that can travel to Mars. In 2018, that figure is expected to drop to 0%.\n(B) Studies have shown that Congress traditionally determines NASA’s budget based on its perception of public interest in NASA’s projects.\n(C) Some scientists are convinced that a mission to Europa would add immeasurably to our understanding of the universe; others believe that we will gain little insight from exploring Europa.\n(D) A new telescope that has been developed in Tokyo allows scientists to look at Europa in ways never possible before and promises to yield more information than the planned mission was designed to provide.\n(E) Most Americans feel that a shuttle to Mars is the next logical step in the development of a system that will eventually allow humans to travel to places as far away as Europa and beyond.\nKudos\nR.A.E\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

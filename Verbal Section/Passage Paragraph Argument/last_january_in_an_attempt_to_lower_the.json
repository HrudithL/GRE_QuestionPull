  "question": "Last January, in an attempt to lower the number of traffic fatalities, the state legislature passed its “Click It or Ticket” law. Under the new law, motorists can be pulled over and ticketed for not wearing their seat belts, even if no additional driving infraction was committed. Lawyers and citizens groups are already protesting the law, saying it unfairly infringes on the rights of the state’s drivers. Law enforcement groups counter these claims by stating that the new regulations will save countless additional lives.\nWhich of the following inferences is best supported by the passage above?\n(A) Prior to the “Click It or Ticket” law, motorists could not be stopped simply for not wearing a seatbelt.\n(B) The “Click It or Ticket” law violates current search and seizure laws.\n(C) Laws similar to “Click It or Ticket” have effectively reduced traffic fatalities in a number of states.\n(D) The previous seat belt laws were ineffective in saving lives.\n(E) Law enforcement groups, rather than citizens groups, should determine how to best ensure the safety of motorists.\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

  "question": "The story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight has its foundation in Arthurian legend as formulated and passed down by the pagan oral tradition. In its written form, however, the tale bears the marks of Christian influence. For all we know, the story may have been \"Christianized\" in its oral form long before it was set it into writing. The poet himself supports this possibility by writing in the opening lines that he will tell \"anew\" the tale \"as I heard it in hall.\" If this is the case, it is distinctly possible that the heroes of the Arthurian tradition represent in the written form a pagan interpretation of Christian ideals, rather than an externally imposed Christianization of pagan codes of behavior.\nThose who would argue that the poet intends to portray Sir Gawain as the perfect Christian hero would point to the descriptions of his chivalric qualities. The poet does indeed describe Gawain's Christian virtues generously; he even makes a special aside early in the second fit to describe the significance of the pagan pentangle embossed on Gawain's shield, and to explain \"why the pentangle is proper to that peerless prince.\" However, in further examination of the poet's descriptions of Sir Gawain, it becomes apparent that the knight's seemingly perfect 15 Christian behavior is superficial. A contrast can be observed between his \"Christian\" words and actions and his decidedly un-Christian motives. One theory is that, by emphasizing this contrast, the poet intends to denounce the pagan \"misunderstanding\" of the Christian message.\nConsider each of the answer choices separately and indicate all that apply.\nWhich of the following can be inferred about the pagan and Christian origins of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight?\nA. As an orally-handed-down tale, it was pagan, but as a written tale, it was Christian.\nB. Sir Gawain was a knight in King Arthur's court.\nC. Sir Gawain and the Green Knight contains both Christian and pagan elements, although it is not clear that either perspective is dominant.\nWhich of the following can be inferred from the author's interpretation of the Christian aspects of the poem presented in the second paragraph?\n(A) Pagans and Christians differ in their interpretations of the Christian symbolism in the story.\n(B) A pagan cannot have motives that are acceptable from a Christian perspective.\n(C) A pagan story cannot be used to convey a Christian attitude.\n(D) Christianity was absent in Arthurian stories before such stories were written down.\n(E) A character representing Christianity would have both the right actions and the right motives.\nWhich of the following, if true, would most undermine the \"theory\" mentioned in the final sentence of the passage?\n(A) Sir Gawain is portrayed as disingenuous in his exercise of \"Christian virtues.\"\n(B) Another character in the story is also associated with pagan symbols and is praised straightforwardly for her Christian virtues.\n(C) Sir Gawain, in the story, prays to God to help him in battle.\n(D) Another character in the story is associated with pagan symbols but is portrayed as having no Christian virtues whatsoever.\n(E) A group of people in the story are portrayed as \"barbarians\" who are neither pagan nor Christian.\nPart of the project:\nGRE Quant & Verbal ADVANCED Daily Challenge 2025 NEW Edition\n-\nGain 20 Kudos\n&\nGet\nFREE\nAccess to GRE Prep Club TESTS\nAlso replying to the\nunanswered questions\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nFree Materials for the GRE General Exam - Where to get it!!\nShorter GRE - Preparing for the Quantitative Reasoning Measure\nShorter GRE - Preparing for the Verbal Reasoning Measure\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #2\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #3\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

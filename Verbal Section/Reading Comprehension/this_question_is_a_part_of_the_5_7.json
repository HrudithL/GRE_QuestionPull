  "question": "This question is a part of The 5 lb. Book of GRE Practice Problems (2nd Ed.) - VERBAL\nPremastication is the practice of a mother pre-chewing food before feeding it, mouth-to-mouth, to her baby. While germophobic Western society eschews this practice, it is not only common in the developing world, but provides benefits to a developing baby. Babies are not born with digestive bacteria; they get some from passing through the birth canal, but continue to encounter the beneficial bacteria during breastfeeding and while being handled, in general, by adults. Throughout most of human history, in fact, babies have received disease-fighting antibodies and digestive bacteria from the mother’s saliva, transmitted via premasticated food. In some cultures, fathers also premasticate food for babies; sometimes even entire family groups will do this— a toddler at a family meal might wander from person to person, being fed by many adults.\nConsider each of the answer choices separately and indicate\nall\nthat apply.\nBased on the information in the passage, the author of the passage would most likely agree that\nGermophobia can contribute to depriving babies of a health benefit.\nPremasticating food for babies is done only in the developing world.\nAdult saliva has benefits for babies in addition to the transmission of beneficial digestive bacteria.\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

  "question": "After 22 years of observations in Shark Bay, Australia, behavioral biologist Janet Mann and her colleagues have discovered that certain bottlenose dolphins, known as spongers, form social networks, showing the first hints of culture among nonhuman animals. Spongers are dolphins that wear marine basket sponges on their beaks as hunting tools, using them to root around on deep sandy bottoms and find fish concealed below the sand. Sponging is a complex hunting technique passed on from mother to offspring. A sponger must know where the sponges grow, how to pick the right sponge, how to remove the sponge intact from the ocean floor, and how and where to properly hunt.\nSpongers typically live solitary lives, but over 22 years of observation, a pattern emerged. The 28 female spongers formed cliques with other female spongers that were not necessarily genetically related to them. This behavior differs from other animal behavior where circumstances, such as genetics or food sources, dictate the formation of groups. The fact that these spongers chose to associate based upon similar, socially learned behaviors makes their cliques a cultural first among animals.\nWhich of the following expresses the main idea of the passage?\n(A) Sponging is a complex behavior used by some dolphins as a hunting technique.\n(B) Any study of animal behavior must take place over an extended period of time in order for patterns to emerge.\n(C) A small set of non-human animals has been found to form social networks.\n(D) Studying how animals form groups is important to our understanding of nature.\n(E) Only humans can form social networks.\nConsider each of the answer choices separately and indicate all that apply.\nWhich of the following can be properly inferred from the passage?\nA. Groups formed by genetic bonds or food supplies do not qualify as social networks.\nB. All spongers of Shark Bay, Australia, form social networks.\nC. Spongers can only be found in Shark Bay, Australia.\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #2\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

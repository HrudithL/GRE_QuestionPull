  "question": "The African American writer and social critic James Baldwin grew up as an outsider to both the language and the culture of power, and yet achieved a balance between self-expression and the language of power. As a child in the 1930s, Baldwin felt acutely separated from a culture of power in which Hollywood movies portrayed an optimistic, capitalist, white America that dealt with white issues and employed white actors. In “Congo Square,” Baldwin opens his essay with an important idea: “A child is far too self-centered to relate to any dilemma which does not, somehow, relate to him.” Watching the films of the dominant culture, Baldwin attempted to relate the information to his own life, connecting with it however he could. Rather than blindly accept the storylines in the movies, when Baldwin saw a staircase in A Tale of Two Cities, he thought, “I knew about staircases.” At the same time, Baldwin distrusted the culture of power: “The civilized ... do not intend to change the status quo ... these people are not to be taken seriously when they speak of the ‘sanctity’ of human life, or the ‘conscience’ of the civilized world.”\nConsider each of the answer choices separately and indicate all that apply.\n​It can be inferred from the passage that Baldwin would agree with which of the following about a 1930s film that dealt only with African American issues and employed only African American actors? ​\nA. It would be significantly better than most Hollywood movies from the 1930s. ​\nB. It would suffer from the same kind of problems as the more typical 1930s Hollywood movies. ​\nC.

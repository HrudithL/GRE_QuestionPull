  "question": "Most mental health disorders and cases of drug abuse tend to diminish a person's ability to recognize other people's feelings. A recent study in Norway suggests, however, that these effects can be bolstered by a nasal spray puff of the brain hormone oxytocin, which is known to increase feelings of calm and social bonding. Although oxytocin is already prescribed for certain disorders that affect social function, such as autism, these treatments are often tried in isolated cases, leaving the overall effects of the drug without evaluation. The Norwegian experiment focused on 40 students, each of whom was given either a control dose of salt water or the drug oxytocin. After the nasal dose, the students were shown faces of happy, angry, or neutral expressions, some of which were subtler than others. The researchers found that after a nasal spray dose of oxytocin, the students' awareness of the expressions was intensified. Further, the experiment showed that the oxytocin had the greatest effect on those who were least able to evaluate emotions properly when given the control.\nAlthough the results of this study seem promising, Leknes, the lead scientist in the investigation, cautions that the hormone would not be a \"cure-all\" for mental illness or drug 15 addiction. Rather, he suggests, the hormone might help some individuals better interpret the social cues from the world around them.\nThe author of the passage would most likely agree with which of the following statements about the brain hormone oxytocin?\n(A) Its overall effects require further evaluation.\n(B) In the future, it will be used to cure mental illness and drug addiction.\n(C) It is not useful for people who are already able to interpret social cues.\n(D) Its effects on the brain are unknown.\n(E) It is more effective when dosed via nasal spray than orally.\nThe passage lends the most support to which of the following conclusions about the nasal spray study of oxytocin?\n(A) The results of the study are inconclusive because a sample set of 40 students is not substantial.\n(B) The nasal spray of oxytocin increased feelings of calm and social bonding for the students.\n(C) Many students were unable to recognize the expressions shown to them when given only the control dose of salt water.\n(D) The students who might need oxytocin most are the ones who appear most responsive to the hormone.\n(E) The subtler the expression, the more difficult it was for the students to identify.\nWhich of the following is not mentioned in the passage regarding the Norwegian study on oxytocin?\n(A) The study showed that oxytocin made students more able to distinguish faces from one another.\n(B) Leknes was the lead scientist in the investigation.\n(C) A control dose of salt water was used to gauge normal student ability to recognize facial expressions.\n(D) Students who participated in the study were shown happy, angry, or neutral expressions.\n(E) Oxytocin had the greatest effect on students who were least able to evaluate emotions properly when given the control dose.\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #2\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #3\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

  "question": "UPDATED Version of the passage located here\nhttps://gre.myprepclub.com/forum/qotd-2 ... tml#p13482\nThe atrocities committed during the Second World War by the National Socialists are well known and have been meticulously documented by historians. Far less known, however, are the mass deportations that took place almost two years after the conclusion of the war, this time orchestrated by the Allied governments. In the years after 1945, over 12 million German- speaking citizens of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Poland were dispossessed, packed into trains, and left to fend for themselves in newly defeated and impoverished Germany. What allowed for this mass exile— the largest forced migration in history—was the confluence of political motivations on the part of the key players. The expelling countries of Eastern and Central Europe were especially keen on punishing Germans for the horrors of the war—though, of course, their own German-speaking populations were hardly responsible for Germany’s actions—and on increasing the ethnic homogeneity within their borders. The Allied powers, too, had something to gain. The Soviet Union, intent on capitalizing politically on German’s defeat, aimed to irrevocably undermine relations between Germany and Poland, especially by ceding German territory to Poland and emptying it of its inhabitants. Britain, weary from the war, hoped the resulting mass suffering would reinforce the completeness of Germany’s defeat. And the United States, in turn, was attempting to cozy up to the nations of Eastern and Central Europe in the hopes of keeping them away from Soviet influence.\nConsider each of the answer choices separately and indicate\nall\nthat apply.\nWhich of the following can be inferred from the passage?\nSome events that occurred during World War II do not appear in history books.\nThe Allied powers included the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and Poland.\nThe Allied powers were not entirely unified on political matters.\nConsider each of the answer choices separately and indicate\nall\nthat apply.\nWhich of the following, if true, would weaken the claim that the Allied powers had something to gain from the deportations?\nThe United States believed that the Eastern and Central European powers hoped to create more multicultural, ethnically mixed societies.\nThe Soviet Union wanted to profit from post-war trade between Germany and Poland.\nBritain, weary of the killing during the war, pledged itself to preventing suffering.\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #2\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

  "question": "Homo economicus, or economic human, denotes the idea of human beings as rational, narrowly self-interested agents who, given total information about opportunities and possible constraints, seek to obtain the highest possible well-being for themselves at the least possible cost. In the late 19th century, a host of economists built mathematical models based on the conception of real humans as Homo economicus. Exponents of Homo economicus tend to acknowledge that total information is not possible in the real world; thus, breakdown in models based on the concept are due to imperfect information held by the self-interested economic actors. Amartya Sen has pointed out that Homo economicus ignores that people can and do commit to courses of action out of morality, cultural expectations, and so forth. Veblen and Keynes allege that Homo economicus assumes far too great an understanding of macroeconomics on the part of humans. Tversky puts forth that investors are not rational: they are unconcerned by small chances of large losses, but quite risk-averse regarding small losses. Bruno Frey points out that humans are often intrinsically motivated, and that such motivation explains heroism, craftsmanship, and other drives that do not fit neatly into the model of a narrowly focused gain-seeker. Critics of the psychoanalytic tradition point out, somewhat obviously, that humans are frequently conflicted, lazy, and inconsistent.\nConsider each of the answer choices separately and indicate\nall\nthat apply.\nWhich of the following phenomena would exemplify Bruno Frey’s critique of Homo economicus?\nA woodworker spends months on the delicate inlay of a door, knowing that his many hours of hard work will inevitably result in a higher price when he comes to sell the piece.\nA television journalist often travels to dangerous countries all over the world because he is contractually obligated to do so, and his ratings are higher the more dangerous his exploits appear to be.\nAn economist dedicates her career to illustrate a fundamental flaw in a particular theory, though she knows there will be no tangible reward for her efforts.\nWhich of the following best describes the main idea of the passage?\n(A) Homo economicus is a useful, if theoretical, actor to use in the formation of mathematical models.\n(B) Homo economicus is a fundamentally flawed and thus theoretically useless construction, for a host of reasons.\n(C) Homo economicus is often criticized by those who don’t fully understand its function in economic theory.\n(D) Homo economicus is a problematic construction, because it simplifies human motivations and is overly optimistic about human understanding.\n(E) Homo economicus fell out of favor with most economists in the 20th century due to its many incorrect assumptions about humanity.\nConsider each of the answer choices separately and indicate\nall\nthat apply.\nWhich of the following is a complaint leveled against the theory of Homo economicus posited by certain economists in the late 19th century?\nIt assumes that the average person knows a lot more about the general workings of the economy than he or she actually does.\nIt assumes that humans experience a proportional and linear emotional response to all risks and rewards.\nIt assumes that the primary impetus behind human decision making is not predicated on ethics or cultural mores.\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #2\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #3\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

    "Homo economicus fell out of favor with most economists in the 20th century due to its many incorrect assumptions about humanity. Consider each of the answer choices separately and indicate all that apply. Which of the following is a complaint leveled against the theory of Homo economicus posited by certain economists in the late 19th century? It assumes that the average person knows a lot more about the general workings of the economy than he or she actually does. It assumes that humans experience a proportional and linear emotional response to all risks and rewards. It assumes that the primary impetus behind human decision making is not predicated on ethics or cultural mores.\n\n\n\nShowHide Answer Question #1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nOfficial Answer\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOfficial Answer and Stats are available only to registered users.

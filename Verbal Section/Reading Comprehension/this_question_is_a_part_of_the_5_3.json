  "question": "This question is a part of The 5 lb. Book of GRE Practice Problems (2nd Ed.) - VERBAL\nA supernova is a brief stellar explosion so luminous that it can briefly outshine an entire galaxy. While the explosion itself takes less than fifteen seconds, supernovae take weeks or months to fade from view; during that time, a supernova can emit an amount of energy equivalent to the amount of energy the sun is expected to radiate over its entire lifespan. Supernovae generate enough heat to create heavy elements, such as mercury, gold, and silver. Although supernovae explode frequently, few of them are visible (from Earth) to the naked eye. In 1604 in Padua, Italy, a supernova became visible, appearing as a star so bright that it was visible in daylight for more than a year. Galileo, who lectured at the university, gave several lectures widely attended by the public. The lectures not only sought to explain the origin of the “star” (some posited that perhaps it was merely “vapour near the earth”), but seriously undermined the views of many philosophers that the heavens were unchangeable. This idea was foundational to a worldview underpinned by a central and all-important Earth, with celestial bodies merely rotating around it.\nThe primary purpose of the passage is to\n(A) give the history of supernovae\n(B) describe a shift in thought as a result of a natural event\n(C) juxtapose two opposing views about supernovae\n(D) corroborate the view that the earth is not central to the universe\n(E) explain how science and philosophy interrelate\nConsider each of the answer choices separately and indicates all that apply.\nWhich of the following can be inferred by the passage?\nSupernovae can take over a year to fade from view.\nPrior to 1604, no one had ever seen a supernova.\nGalileo convinced philosophers of the incorrectness of their views.\nThe author mentions which of the following as a result of the supernova of 1604?\n(A) The supernova created and dispersed the heavy elements out of which the Earth and everything on it is made.\n(B) Galileo explained the origin of the supernova.\n(C) The public was interested in hearing lectures about the phenomenon.\n(D) Galileo’s lectures were opposed by philosophers.\n(E) Those who thought the supernova was “vapor” were proved wrong.\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #2\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #3\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

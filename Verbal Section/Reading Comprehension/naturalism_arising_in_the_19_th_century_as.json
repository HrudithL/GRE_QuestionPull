  "question": "Naturalism, arising in the 19 th century as a literary response to Darwin's account of evolution, focused on describing everyday reality but differed from realism in its attempts to provide a \"scientific\" foundation for its depictions of characters, stressing the influence of environment and heredity upon the individual psyche. Émile Zola, in particular, saw his craft as an extension of the scientific method into the domain of art. The 19 th century, perhaps in opposition to naturalism, saw the rise of the Decadent movement, embracing artifice over nature in writing, championed by Zola's erstwhile protégé, Joris-Karl Huysmans. The protagonist of his masterpiece, Á rebours (literally, Against the Grain, but more commonly translated as Against Nature), removes himself from society-viewing it as the product of a nature long surpassed by human ingenuity—and surrounds himself exclusively with art, perfume, literature, and technology.\nConsider each of the answer choices separately and indicate all that apply.\nWhich of the following can be inferred from the passage about perfume?\nA.

  "question": "During the 1960s and ’70s, scientists were concerned and puzzled by a large gap in the human fossil record. The “aquatic ape theory” gained prominence as an explanation for this gap. This theory posited that primitive humans were forced toward a littoral lifestyle by competition for arboreal resources. Analogies were made to seal populations, who sleep on land at night but spend most of their days in coastal waters. Proponents pointed to various physiological human attributes, such as bipedalism and the webbing between human toes, as extant adaptations.\nHowever, the aspect of the theory that captured the public imagination and undoubtedly boosted its standing was the point that this hypothesis explained human hairlessness; as with dolphins, this streamlining would facilitate swimming and diving. Proponents noted that the remaining body hair would also match the flow of water.\nNonetheless, despite the popular stature of the theory, the scientific community almost unanimously rejects it as mere conjecture. While bipedalism does facilitate swimming, it is even more of an advantage in terrestrial pursuits. Further, biomechanical analysis indicates that humans remain such inadequate swimmers that they could not so succeed. As for hairlessness, critics point out that other semi-aquatic mammals actually have dense fur and/or barrel shaped torsos for heat retention. Today, the theory, while still championed by a prominent writer but\nnon-scientist\n, has no serious support among mainstream-trained paleoanthropologists.\nThe passage implies that, according to the theory, a male aquatic ape would most likely do which of the following?\nA. ​Spend almost all of its time in the water ​\nB. Spend its nights in the water, but its days partly on land ​\nC. Spend its days partly in the water, but its nights partly on land\nD. ​Spend its days mostly in the water, but its nights on land ​\nE. Spend almost all its time on land\nThe author describes a remaining proponent of the theory as a “\nnon-scientist\n” in order to do which of the following? ​\nA. Cast doubt upon her objectivity\nB. Tout the superiority of common sense over academics ​\nC. Cast doubt upon her expertise ​\nD. Cast doubt upon mainstream paleoanthropologists\nE. ​Illustrate the sexism of mainstream scientists\nPart of the project:\nGRE Quant & Verbal ADVANCED Daily Challenge 2024 Edition\n-\nGain 20 Kudos\n&\nGet\nFREE\nAccess to GRE Prep Club TESTS\nAlso replying to the\nunanswered questions\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nFree Materials for the GRE General Exam - Where to get it!!\nShorter GRE - Preparing for the Quantitative Reasoning Measure\nShorter GRE - Preparing for the Verbal Reasoning Measure\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #2\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

  "question": "Homer's The Odyssey is an epic poem that put a popular oral myth into writing for the first time. The Histories is an attempt by its author Herodotus to provide an\nunbiased\naccount of historical conflicts in the Hellenistic world. These two works share two important motifs: the interference of the gods in the events of the mortal world, and the concept of a predetermined and unavoidable destiny. One might assume that these two themes are one and the same-a predetermined fate set forth by the gods. However, Homer's and Herodotus's gods are presented as acting in a political fashion-each one acting within certain boundaries to accomplish his or her own agenda. As such, the wills of the gods do not coincide to allow for the formulation of a cohesive \"master plan.\" Instead of destiny created by the gods, Homer and Herodotus present fate as something beyond the gods-a driving force under which the actions of gods and mortals lead to the realization of destiny. In The Odyssey and The Histories, the idea of gods with limited power leads to a conception of fate wherein the gods act not as the creators of destiny, but as agents of its fulfillment.\nWhich of the following, if true, would most strongly support the assumption rejected by the argument of the passage?\n(A) The gods pursue their agendas by conferring with other gods to ensure that their agendas serve a common goal.\n(B) The agendas of gods and mortals frequently coincide with the demands of fate.\n(C) Homer and Herodotus disagree strongly about the motives and agendas of the gods, as well as about the nature and severity of their conflicts.\n(D) Destiny would be fulfilled regardless of what activities gods and mortals engaged in.\n(E) In both Homer and Herodotus, gods and mortals frequently examine their motives and goals and are capable of making their own decisions about what to do.\nThe author most likely uses the term \"\nunbiased\n\" to convey which of the following ideas?\n(A) The historical conflicts are presented in a way that precludes religious explanation.\n(B) The historical conflicts are presented in a way that does not favor any particular party to the conflicts.\n(C) The subjects of the histories are not restricted to any particular ethnic, social, religious, or geographical group.\n(D) The historical conflicts are explained entirely by reference to the actions of the people and states involved in them.\n(E) The histories are written in such a way as to challenge the sensibilities of their readers.\nConsider each of the answer choices separately and indicate all that apply.\nWhich of the following can be inferred about the gods in The Odyssey and The Histories?\nA. There are limits to what the gods can accomplish.\nB. The gods, like human beings, pursue their own interests.\nC. The gods do not control the final outcomes of their actions.\nPart of the project:\nGRE Quant & Verbal ADVANCED Daily Challenge 2025 NEW Edition\n-\nGain 20 Kudos\n&\nGet\nFREE\nAccess to GRE Prep Club TESTS\nAlso replying to the\nunanswered questions\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nFree Materials for the GRE General Exam - Where to get it!!\nShorter GRE - Preparing for the Quantitative Reasoning Measure\nShorter GRE - Preparing for the Verbal Reasoning Measure\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #2\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #3\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

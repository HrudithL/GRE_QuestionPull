  "question": "The Norton-Polk-Mathis House in San Antonio displays an integrated design well-suited to the primary purpose of the building: to impress. This is evidenced by the fact that the building was designed with the street it faces in mind. Only the South façade is architecturally interesting or involved-the sides of the building are flat, featureless, and uninteresting. The 5 house was designed not only as a living area, but also as a structure to be seen from the street. The building reflects typical Renaissance ideals of order and weight, and, while it is asymmetrical, it is well balanced and stable. The choice of materials also reflects the \"re-discovery\" of antiquity prevalent in the Italian Renaissance. The white stone lends an elegant simplicity to the building yet it radiates an air of strength and mass reminiscent of the Parthenon or the Athenian 10 temples-especially when juxtaposed with the other, seemingly fragile brick and wood homes of the neighborhood.\nConsider all that apply\nWhich of the following can be inferred about the Norton-Polk-Mathis House?\nA. It was built during the Italian Renaissance.\nB. Its primary purpose was utilitarian in nature.\nC. It appears stronger than other nearby homes.\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

  "question": "American composer and conductor John Philip Sousa viewed the increasing popularity of the phonograph with deep dismay. He suggested that it would \"reduce the expression of music to a mathematical system of megaphones, wheels, cogs, disks, cylinders, and all manner of revolving things, which are as like real art as the marble statue of Eve is like her beautiful, living, breathing daughters.\" Such \"mechanical\" music was not sincere, according to Sousa: \"The nightingale's song is delightful because the nightingale herself gives it forth. The boy with a penny whistle and glass of water may give an excellent imitation, but let him persist, he is sent to bed as a nuisance.\"\nSousa further decried a \"decline in domestic music,\" noting the decline of musical instrument purchases and predicting that when music comes so easily out of a phonograph, mothers will not bother to sing lullabies to their babies. He opined that when music is so readily playable, musical and vocal instruction as a normal part of education will fall out of fashion, the \"tide of amateurism\" receding, and music will become the province of machines and professional singers only. \"What of the national throat?\" asked Sousa. \"Will it not weaken? What of the\nnational chest\n? Will it not shrink?\"\nConsider each of the answer choices separately and indicate all that apply.\nWhich of the following, if they occurred, would contradict Sousa's arguments?\nA. A private school that once demanded two semesters of vocal instruction as a requirement for graduation now offers the same classes as electives.\nB. A young boy in an isolated rural area during the Great Depression hears a professional bluegrass band for the first time on a phonograph, and it inspires him to ask his grandfather to teach him to play the family banjo.\nC. A modern recording artist comments that, because of her terrible stage fright, her live performances are less genuine than the recordings she is able to produce when she feels comfortable in the studio.\nIn the context in which it appears, \"\nnational chest\n\" most nearly refers to\n(A) the performances of professional singers\n(B) the U.S. Treasury\n(C) the phonograph\n(D) the vocal abilities of amateur American singers\n(E) musical instruments found in American homes\nPart of the project:\nGRE Quant & Verbal ADVANCED Daily Challenge 2025 NEW Edition\n-\nGain 20 Kudos\n&\nGet\nFREE\nAccess to GRE Prep Club TESTS\nAlso replying to the\nunanswered questions\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nFree Materials for the GRE General Exam - Where to get it!!\nShorter GRE - Preparing for the Quantitative Reasoning Measure\nShorter GRE - Preparing for the Verbal Reasoning Measure\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #1\nShow\nHide\nAnswer Question #2\n_________________\nGRE Prep WhatsApp Community -\nJOIN US\n!!\nGRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions\nHow to achieve your target GRE score on a budget!!!\nGRE Hard and Tricky\nVERBAL\nPractice: NEW Questions Daily 2025\n!!\nGRE-Skill Builder Project II Ed.2025 DAILY\nQUANT\nQUESTIONS TO PRACTICE\n!!\nThe Best GRE Books of 2025\n!!\nSignature Read More",

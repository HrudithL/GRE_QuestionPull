  "question": "In 1977, the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) was passed for the purpose of reducing discriminatory credit practices in low-income neighborhoods. The act required Federal financing supervisory agencies to use their authority to encourage lending institutions to meet the credit needs of all borrowers in their communities. The CRA had little impact until 1993, when the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) initiated legal proceedings against lenders who declined too many applications from minority borrowers. Some argue that, while providing equal access to credit is an important aim, pressure on lenders from HUD led to practices that later caused those same lenders to be assailed as “predatory.” In Housing Boom and Bust, economist Thomas Sowell wrote that the CRA, far from being as benign as it appeared, was based on a flawed assumption: that government officials were qualified to tell banks how to lend the money entrusted to them by depositors and investors.\nConsider each of the answer choices separately and indicate\nall\nthat apply.\n1.
